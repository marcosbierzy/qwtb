# QWTB

QWTB is a software toolbox written in MATLAB/GNU Octave. It aims for aggregation of high-quality algorithms required for data processing of sampled measurements. QWTB consist of data processing algorithms from different sources, unifying application interface and graphical user interface.

The toolbox gives the possibility to use different data processing algorithms with one set of data and removes the need to reformat data for every particular algorithm. Toolbox is extensible. The toolbox can variate input data and calculate uncertainties by means of Monte Carlo Method (MCM).

Toolbox does not require to modify source code of Algorithms, it adapts.

Typical use case: you make a sampling and you want to: get frequency spectra, calculate amplitude and phase of main sine signal and calculate Allan deviation. But you do not want to search algorithms, to learn how to use these algorithms and to reformat variables for every one algorithm. Solution? QWTB!

## QWTB can help with:
- searching of useful algorithms,
- learning how to use algorithms,
- application of algorithms to a user data.

## QWTB has:
- standardized format of (input/output) quantities independent on the required algorithm,
- standardized use of algorithms,
- examples for every implemented algorithm,
- full documentation with examples,
- integration into LabVIEW
- graphical user interface,
- ability to variate inputs and calculate uncertainties by means of Monte Carlo Method.
- tests for every implemented algorithm.

## QWTB is:
- easy to use,
- open source,
- extensible.
