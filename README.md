#Quantum Wave Tool Box (QWTB) is a toolbox for evaluation of measured data.

QWTB consist of data processing algorithms from very different sources and unifying application
interface. The toolbox gives the possibility to use different data processing algorithms with one
set of data and removes the need to reformat data for every particular algorithm. Toolbox is
extensible. The toolbox can variate input data and calculate uncertainties by means of Monte Carlo
Method (MCM).
