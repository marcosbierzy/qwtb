{"name":"QWTB","tagline":"Quantum Wave ToolBox","body":"# Quantum Wave Tool Box (QWTB)\r\n\r\nQWTB is a toolbox for evaluation of sampled data. QWTB consist of data processing algorithms from\r\nvery different sources and unifying application interface.\r\n\r\nThe toolbox gives the possibility to use different data processing algorithms with one\r\nset of data and removes the need to reformat data for every particular algorithm. Toolbox is\r\nextensible. The toolbox can variate input data and calculate uncertainties by means of Monte Carlo\r\nMethod (MCM).\r\n\r\nTypical use case: you make a sampling and you want to: get frequency spectra, calculate amplitude\r\nand phase of main sine signal and calculate Allan deviation. But you do not want to search algorithms,\r\nto learn how to use these algorithms and to reformat variables for every one algorithm. Solution? QWTB!\r\n\r\n## Toolbox removes:\r\n- a need to find algorithm sources,\r\n- a need to learn how to use algorithms,\r\n- a need to reformat your data in variables to fit oher algorithm.\r\n\r\n## Toolbox has:\r\n- standardized format of (input/output) quantities independent on the required algorithm,\r\n- standardized application of algorithms,\r\n- ability to variate inputs and calculate uncertainties by means of Monte Carlo Method.\r\n- examples for every implemented algorithm,\r\n- full documentation with examples,\r\n- tests for every implemented algorithm.\r\n\r\n# Toolbox is:\r\n- easy to use,\r\n- open source,\r\n- extensible.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
