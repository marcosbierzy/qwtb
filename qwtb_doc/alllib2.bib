This paper describes the efforts undertaken at the NRC and the experience that was gained. An experimental method of measuring corrections for the voltage probe lead errors is described, and first results are reported. By introducing the ACJVS, the NRC will be able to reduce the uncertainties of the thermal transfer standard calibration by threefold on the 200-mV range and five- to tenfold on the 20-mV range, in comparison with thermal-converter- and micropotentiometer-based calibrations.},

AC voltage synthesis is performed by switching between quantized Josephson voltages. The accuracy of a synthesized Josephson ac voltage is limited by the transition error. We present an experimental method for determination of a correction for the transition error. The method is based on the assumption of a linear frequency dependence of the transition error. Measurements up to 1 kHz have been performed. Using the transition error correction at different frequencies has shown a frequency-independent Josephson ac voltage step width.},

We have investigated the frequency dependence for several output voltages up to 200 mV for frequencies from 2.5 to 100 kHz. We found that, as the frequency increases, the ac-dc differences for the two arrays on the same chip do not agree. We explored this deviation in ac-dc difference for the two arrays by investigating different configurations of the probe cabling and wiring, chip carriers, and on-chip circuit design. We found that the circuit design produced the greatest improvement, particularly at the highest frequency (100 kHz), where the deviation in ac-dc difference was reduced by more than 60\%. In this paper, we also demonstrate tenfold higher output voltages and improved operating margins for arbitrary (nonsinusoidal) waveforms. These enhancements were accomplished by implementing a more general current bias to the arrays having the same harmonic content as that of the synthesized arbitrary waveform.},

“Software for calibration problems developed and tested” of the EMRP project “Novel mathematical and statistical approaches to uncertainty evaluation” (EMRP NEW04).
The software may be applied to pairs (x, y) of measurement values, where x is the
independent/explanatory variable and y the dependent/explained variable. If uncertainties associated with the data are available, they can be provided as inputs to the software, otherwise the software is able to estimate them on the basis of repeated measurements.
The regression models which can be addressed by the software are (fractional) polynomial curves. In order to determine estimates of the parameters of the curve and evaluate associated uncertainty
and covariance information, the software can perform the following kind of regression procedures, corresponding to statistical models 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b, respectively, described in deliverable D1.1.4 of the NEW04 project: Ordinary least-squares regression (OLS) for models 1a and 1b; Weighted least-squares regression (WLS) for models 2a and 2b; Weighted total least-squares regression (WTLS) for models 3a and 3b.},

The typical circuit consists of an array of superconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junctions, which are placed in a transmission line and biased with a broad-band (dc-to-15 GHz) pulse-drive waveform. Additional low-speed (dc and audio frequency) bias and output leads contain on-chip inductors that act as low-pass filters. The operating margins of the array were improved by adding resistive shunts across these inductors to damp their intrinsic resonances. These resonances had previously degraded the integrity of the broad-band signal driving the array. We present simulations and measurements of these improved circuits that demonstrate no resonances in the range of 0.1-20 GHz. Moreover, the operating margins of the ac Josephson voltage standard were improved},

  url = {http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1736336},
  abstract = {Voltage fluctuations and rapid voltage changes lead to lamps flickering and disturbance of visual perception may occur consequently. For evaluation of the flicker severity level by means of voltage measurement there was developed an instrument called flickermeter, which is based on a reference incandescent bulb - human eye - brain of average observer chain response modeling. The signal processing technique implemented in a standard flickermeter, standardized by international standard bodies, simulates fundamental behavior of the reference incandescent bulb which is sensitive mainly to low-frequency amplitude modulation of the voltage. The voltage magnitude fluctuation could be introduced also by subharmonic and/or interharmonic components superimposed on a voltage waveform. In frequency domain, the boundary interharmonic frequency of a amplitude voltage modulation is approx. double of the fundamental system frequency (f1) and the response of the standard flickermeter to the interharmonic voltages is also up to frequency of 2*f1. However high-frequency voltage interharmonics at frequencies over 2*f1 beating with voltage fundamental waveform are likewise able to produce the disturbing light flicker. It applies to all types of lamps, except the incandescent one and the instrument is expected to properly work and measure also the effects of these interharmonics. The paper presents a new type of flickermeter utilizing proposed signal processing approach to high-frequency interharmonic voltage - flicker detection which is based on voltage peak detection. Realization of the new flickermeter type in Matlab Simulink is discussed and its characteristics in terms of numerical simulations are shown.},

  abstract = {We are developing a quantum-based 60 Hz power standard that exploits the precision sinusoidal reference voltages synthesized by a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS). PJVS systems use series arrays of Josephson junctions as a multibit digital-to-analog converter to produce accurate quantum-based dc voltages. Using stepwise-approximation synthesis, the system can also generate arbitrary ac waveforms {[}i.e., an ac programmable Josephson voltage standard (ACPJVS){]} and, in this application, produces sine waves with calculable root mean square (rms) voltage and spectral content. The primary drawback to this ACPJVS synthesis technique is the uncertainty that results from switching between the discrete voltages due to finite rise times and transient signals. In this paper, we present measurements and simulations that elucidate some of the error sources that are intrinsic to the ACPJVS when used for rms measurements. In particular, we consider sine waves synthesized at frequencies up to the audio range, where the effect of these errors is more easily measured because the fixed transition time becomes a greater fraction of the time in each quantized voltage state. Our goal for the power standard is to reduce all error sources and uncertainty contributions from the PJVS-synthesized waveforms at 60 Hz to a few parts in 107 so that the overall uncertainty in an ac power standard will be a few parts in 106.},

It is shown how data from within-group comparisons can be used to investigate medium-term deviations of a standard's output from its uniform drift behavior.

Stacking enables the junctions to be packed more densely, thus increasing design flexibility and margins for the microwave circuits.

  abstract = {One aspect of the problem of the measurement of the losses in low power factor devices such as power transformers or power reactors is the verification of the phase angle properties of both the complete system and its various component parts. The use of a digital phase standard as a solution to this and other phase measurement problems is proposed. When a phase standard is synchronized in both phase and frequency, then its precise digital phase shift properties, used in conjunction with passive phase bridges, allow the design of high-power, high-accuracy (better than 0.001), phase verification schemes. Methods using this approach are outlined that use commercially available, easily transportable equipment to provide rapid and accurate phase angle measurements for almost all possible combinations of current and voltage},

We have constructed a bias current source and a buffer amplifier connected to the array which enable fast switching between steps. In this paper, we describe the system used for generation of the square wave and present experimental results which show that the accuracy of the fundamental frequency component amplitude of the square wave is sufficient for realization of a standard with accuracy better than 1 × 10-6.},

We show that, contrary to previous understanding, these two methods also give identical results for the standard errors in slope and intercept, provided that the least-squares estimation expressions are evaluated at the least-squares-adjusted points rather than at the observed points as has been done traditionally. This unification of standard errors holds when both x and y observations are subject to correlated errors that vary from point to point. All known correct regression solutions in the literature, including various special cases, can be derived from the original York equations.We present a compact set of equations for the slope, intercept, and newly unified standard errors.},

The concept of load signature is explained, and measurements are analyzed and conducted according to specific criteria that may be used for the automated recognition of the operation of individual loads. To that purpose, LV loads that may be found in a residential installation are initially classified into categories according to their operational characteristics. Furthermore, the notion of load “labeling” is introduced as a fundamental step towards the development of efficient load recognition mechanisms. Moreover, the load recognition criteria are analyzed and classified into the ones that presuppose the existence of direct measurements, and the ones that may be indirectly calculated. Subsequently, the implemented measurement setup is presented, along with a set of measurements regarding specific LV loads, corresponding to the aforementioned load classification. The respective results are analyzed, denoting thus the limitations of the process of using the concept of load signature for the recognition of the loads' individual operation.},

In this paper, we present results on the influence of the voltmeter synchronization and measurement parameters on the root-mean-square (RMS) measurements of Josephson stepwise-approximated sine waves for different frequencies. Our results show that for aperture times above 100 mus, the measured RMS voltage shows a large step in value with respect to shorter aperture times and is much more accurate. Furthermore, to obtain 0.2 muV/V accuracy, we show that for stepwise-approximated sine waves at 53 Hz, delay times higher than 10 mus are necessary. A slight delay time dependence limits the accuracy for frequencies above a few hundred hertz.},

Using stepwise-approximation synthesis, the PJVS systems produce sinewaves with precisely calculable RMS voltage and spectral content. We present measurements and calculations that elucidate the sources of error in the RMS voltage that are intrinsic to the digital-synthesis technique and that are due to the finite rise times and transients that occur when switching between the discrete voltages. Our goal is to reduce all error sources and uncertainty contributions from the PJVS synthesized waveforms to a few parts in 10 7 so that the overall uncertainty in the AC-power standard is a few parts in 106},

One 10 pF travelling standard belonging to the CMI was used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A–B–A' pattern of measurements; the standard was measured first at the CMI for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the BIPM, and finally again at the CMI. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz and for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a.

  abstract = {This paper presents a new nonintrusive appliance load monitoring technique based on the integer programming. Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring is a problem to identify the operating conditions of the electric appliances in a house only by observing the overall load current and voltage. Since the overall load current is expressed as a superposition of each current of the operating appliance, the monitoring problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem by expressing the operating conditions as integer variables. This problem is solvable with sufficiently small computational burden thanks to the recent development of the commercial software. The proposed method does not require the relearning even when a new appliance is installed in the house. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is applicable to cases that some appliance has multiple modes, and cases that some same-type appliances operate simultaneously. Usefulness of the proposed technique is verified through some experimental results.},

This paper reviews the development of Josephson voltage standards including the junction and array design, the microwave circuit, and the system integration. With the dc Josephson standard largely transferred to the commercial sector, NIST is developing a new class of devices in which the output voltage can be rapidly programmed either by digitally selecting the quantum number N or by driving the Josephson array with a variable frequency pulse train. These new devices will make possible fast, high-accuracy characterizations of A/D and D/A converters and the synthesis of ac waveforms},

A detrimental effect of the transients occurring during the transition between different voltage steps is to make the ac Josephson voltage dependent on the bias current in the junctions. In other words, the current margins where the array behaves as a quantum standard are reduced to zero: the voltage steps have a slope. However, by using square waveforms, the effect of the transients can be reduced to a level where this slope is no longer measurable. This observation will probably lead to a simplification in the development of a new type of high-precision Josephson-based waveform synthesizer.},

  abstract = {Amorphous Nb-Si has been previously demonstrated as a Josephson junction barrier material for Nb-based superconducting voltage standard circuits, including both DC programmable and AC Josephson voltage standards operating at frequencies up to 20 GHz. This material was chosen so that the junctions could be fabricated in vertical stacks, increasing the number of junctions in an array, which in turn increases the output voltage of the circuits. This barrier material may also be used to create higher-speed junctions, because the same factors that lead to improved stacks also lead to more reproducible junctions with thin, insulating barriers. Recently, a collaboration between the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) produced 1 V and 10 V programmable Josephson voltage standard chips operating at 75 GHz that use these junctions. In this paper, we demonstrate junctions with characteristic frequencies approaching 500 GHz and observed Josephson phase locking at frequencies of 400 GHz and 800 GHz. These junctions are promising for applications in high-speed superconducting digital electronics.},

One 10 pF travelling standard belonging to the CMI was used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A?B?A' pattern of measurements; the standard was measured first at the CMI for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the BIPM, and finally again at the CMI. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz and for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a. The results from the CMI and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95\% confidence, k = 2) of 4.2 ? 10?7. Main text.

We demonstrate the operating margins for these circuits and use them to measure the harmonic distortion of a commercial digitizer. Having exceeded the threshold of 125 mV rms for a single array of Josephson junctions, we propose and discuss the features of an eight-array circuit that is capable of achieving 1 V rms. We investigate the use of a resistive divider to extend the ACJVS voltage accuracy to higher voltages. By the use of a switched-input measurement technique, an integrating sampling digital voltmeter, a resistive voltage divider, and ACJVS synthesized sine waves as reference voltages, we characterize the stability of a commercial calibration source for a few voltages up to 2.7 V.},

  abstract = {Arrays of Josephson junctions have been used successfully for many years as the primary standard of voltage. A recent development has been the fabrication of arrays, based on nonhysteretic Josephson junctions, which allows the voltage output to be changed almost instantaneously. When these arrays are divided into binary segments a 'digital-to-analogue converter' with quantum accuracy is created. The properties of two types of array, a SINIS (superconductor-insulator-normal conductor-insulator-superconductor) array, using intrinsic shunting of the Josephson junctions, and a SIS (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) array with external, on-chip shunting have been investigated. The accuracy of the generated voltages and AC properties of the arrays when driven with a purpose-built, programmable current bias source are discussed. It is anticipated that a Josephson standard having waveforms with calculable RMS values of AC voltage will soon be available.},

In the metrological field, several types of software have already been dedicated to the determination of calibration curves, some being focused just on problem (i) and a few others considering also problem (ii) but only for a straight-line fitting model. The proposed algorithm is able to deal with problems (i) and (ii) at the same time, for a generic fitting model. The tool was developed in the MATLAB® environment and validated on several benchmark data sets, fitted with linear and non-linear regression models.A review of the most commonly applied approximations to the parameter uncertainty is also presented, together with a Monte Carlo method proposed for comparison purposes with the results provided by the formula for the uncertainty evaluation which is implemented in the software.},

The arrays are optimized for the highest voltage operation with the largest operating margins for the current bias. Measurements show that these arrays, driven with 20 GHz microwaves, generate a dc voltage greater than 680 mV per array with a dc bias margin over 1 mA. To increase the microwave uniformity across the array, the transmission line impedance has been tapered. By use of this technique, ac Josephson voltages over 110 mVrms per array have been generated, also with over 1 mA dc bias margin.},

The D/A converter is based on RSFQ (Rapid Single Flux Quantum) logic circuits, and consists of a frequency multiplier (FM), a pulse distributor (PD), and a number of voltage multipliers (VMs). Each VM circuit, corresponding to the n-th bit digital code, multiplies the number of SFQ pulses by a factor of 2 n. By gating the input SFQ pulses from the FM to the VMs using the PD circuits, a programmable output voltage is obtained. Possible sources of uncertainties in the measurement of the rms value of the synthesized sine wave are discussed},

Frequency-dependent voltage noise was studied with a very low-frequency spectrum analyzer, and was found to be the major factor limiting short-term stability to about one par tin 108. For two of the three reference standards tested, humidity effects were the principal factors limiting the medium- and long-term stability of the 1.018 V outputs. These effects were studied by subjecting the standards to step-function changes in relative humidity. For example, increases in ambient relative humidity of 0.01 were found to provoke decreases of 0.05-0.15 muV in the 1.018 V output of one Zener. The time lag between the humidity change and the voltage change is characterized by a time constant ≥ 19 days},

A system for calibration and testing of meters with load identification ability is presented in this paper. The system was based on generating arbitrary current waveforms of previously sampled home appliances. A tested NILM should measure the waveform and identify the simulated appliance. The load identification probability was measured for a selected LIA. An NILM was simulated by a common power quality meter and load identification was performed afterward in a computer. Simulations and sensitivity analysis were also performed to determine minimal properties of an NILM with selected LIA. The results showed that the system is able to measure load identification probability of an NILM and even detect various problems of the LIA.},

The output voltage is a factor of 4-6 higher than the amplitude of previous unipolar waveforms; this is achieved by generating bipolar waveforms where arrays of junctions are driven with both a broadband two-level digital code and a sinusoidal frequency. We experimentally demonstrate two bipolar waveforms: a 5 kHz sine wave with ±18 mV peak amplitude and quantization noise power eight orders of magnitude below the power in the fundamental frequency, and a 3.5 kHz square wave with ±13 mV peak amplitude and even harmonics at -100 dB (carrier)},

In the context of sustainable development, this is of growing interest and rapid evolution subject in recent years. The objective is to manage energy consumption by the determination of the operating schedule of individual appliances. These approaches have been developed to simplify the collection of energy consumption data. This technique for gathering appliance load information doesnpsilat require placing sensors on individual appliances, and hence an intrusion into the energy consumerpsilas property. This paper proposes an overview of the most popular methods and describes their advantages and disadvantages. It opens new perspectives which are under development in our laboratory. Our goal is to reduce the complexity of monitoring appliances and to find the most efficient method for identification.},

Using a Fast Fourier Transform spectrum analyzer and an ac-dc transfer standard, we characterize ACJVS operating margins by performing "flat-spot" measurements at the level of a part in 106 for all eight bias parameters. By verifying that every bias parameter has a "flat-spot" (i.e., a range of bias values over which the measured ACJVS output is precisely constant), we demonstrate that all Josephson junctions on the chip are operating properly.},

  abstract = {Providing the traceability of alternating-current (ac) voltage measurements by means of a stepwise-approximated sine wave (SASW) produced by a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) is an attractive alternative to the conventional ac voltage standards based on thermal voltage converters, because a programmable Josephson standard has a calculable output voltage that does not drift with time. This paper investigates two aspects of uncertainties in the measurement of ac voltage using a sine wave generated by a PJVS with a lock-in amplifier as a null detector. First, the uncertainty introduced by transitions between successive voltage levels of the SASW on the fundamental and root-mean-square values is examined. Second, the lock-in amplifier response to the harmonics of this synthesized sine wave is discussed. Experimental evaluation shows that harmonics that are not rejected by the lock-in amplifier can cause a systematic error when measuring the ac-direct-current difference of a thermal converter with the synthesized sine wave from 0.5 to 3.0 μV/V, depending on the number of samples per period of the SASW. Furthermore, it is shown that this error can be reduced to 0.3 μV/V by calibrating the lock-in amplifier using a distorted signal having a similar harmonic content to the synthesized sine wave.},

Clearly, this definition has the effect of fixing the value of m(K) to be one kilogram exactly. In this paper, we review the benefits that would accrue if the kilogram were redefined so as to fix the value of either the Planck constant h or the Avogadro constant NA instead of m(K), without waiting for the experiments to determine h or NA currently underway to reach their desired relative standard uncertainty of about 10-8 . A significant reduction in the uncertainties of the SI values of many other fundamental constants would result from either of these new definitions, at the expense of making the mass m(K) of the international prototype a quantity whose value would have to be determined by experiment. However, by assigning a conventional value to m(K), the present highly precise worldwide uniformity of mass standards could still be retained. The advantages of redefining the kilogram immediately outweigh any apparent disadvantages, and we review the alternative forms that a new definition might take.},

  abstract = {The amplitude of the current steps induced by a rf field in a Josephson junction is strictly related to the stability of the phase‐locked state. We show how the ac Josephson effect can be enhanced by means of a proper drive: when two phased ac fields of angular frequencies \$ømega\$ and 2\$ømega\$ are added together, the rf‐induced steps have maximum normalized amplitudes larger than the Bessel functions as predicted for a sinusoidal drive. Furthermore, in the limiting case of a driving signal that consists of an impulse train, the stability of the phase‐locked state can reach its maximum value, i.e., rf‐induced steps as large as the critical current can be obtained. Experimental evidence of the enhanced ac Josephson effect is reported for a highly hysteretic Nb/Al‐Al2O3/Nb Josephson tunnel junction. The enhanced ac Josephson effect may open new ways for the understanding of the nonlinear dynamics of Josephson junctions and for the design of more efficient Josephson voltage standard devices.},

The application of the procedures to a specific set of key comparison data provides a key comparison reference value (KCRV) and the associated uncertainty, the degree of equivalence of the measurement made by each participating national institute and the degrees of equivalence between measurements made by all pairs of participating institutes. Procedure A is based on the use of the weighted mean, together with consistency checks based on classical statistics regarding its applicability. Should the checks fail, action to remedy the situation is suggested. If the remedy is inappropriate, Procedure B can be applied instead. It is based on the use of the median (or any another informed choice) as a more robust estimator in the circumstances.},

These junctions derive from the Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb SIS junctions using a relatively thick Al layer oxidized at a low value of oxygen exposure. This produces junctions with reproducible and spatially homogeneous I-V characteristics, having current densities ranging from 103 to more than 2×104 A/cm2 and characteristic voltages up to 0.40 mV. The authors report here the rf response of these junctions at 70 GHz. The authors have measured the dependence of the rf-induced steps on the microwave power and the stability of the steps, in view of a future application of these junctions to an AC Josephson voltage standard.},

We also developed a phase meter calibrator (PMC) for calibrating the DPM. Since the DPM and PMC are synchronized with a single clock, the DPM can be calibrated by a very simple measurement method, which no longer requires extra standards. The DPM has been employed as an instrument for the primary standard of power and energy in Japan to achieve precise phase angle measurement. Since the error in the power measurement at power factor 0 is equal to the error in the phase angle measurement, we verified the performance of the DPM by calibrating a standard power meter using the power calibrators at JEMIC and Physikalische-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), and comparing the test results at power factor 0. According to the measurement, the phase angle difference between JEMIC and PTB is within 7 \${\textbackslash}backslash\$textmu rad.},

Here, sampling measurements and procedures using binary-divided 1 V and 10 V arrays are investigated. In addition, a quantum-based analogue-to-digital converter for direct measurements of arbitrary waveforms is under development.

It is possible to use modem state and parameter estimation algorithms to verify remotely the "health" of electromechanical loads by using NILM to analyze measured waveforms associated with the operation of individual loads. NILM can also monitor the operation of the electrical distribution system itself, identifying situations where two or more otherwise healthy loads interfere with each other's operation through voltage waveform distortion or power quality problems. Strategies for nonintrusive monitoring have developed over the last 20 years. Advances in computing technology make a new wealth of computational tools useful in practical, field-based NILM systems. This article reviews techniques for high-performance nonintrusive load and diagnostic monitoring and illustrates key points with results from field tests.},

Crucial part of the traceability chain, an optical frequency comb generator linking optical frequencies to atomic clocks, is described in detail. The frequency comb generator is used in frequency calibrations of iodine-stabilized lasers, which are operated in compliance with the recommendations of the practical realization of the definition of the meter. Measured absolute frequencies of iodine-stabilized lasers, time records of the measurements, and the respective Allan deviations demonstrate the solid performance of the MIKES laser frequency standards. The results are in good agreement with the recommended values, as well as with the independent characterizations of the measured lasers},

We show that direct analog-to-digital converter measurements of the SES of two on-chip Josephson arrays are in very good agreement with errors inferred from AC-DC transfer standard measurements. Finally, we demonstrate that the reduction of the SES using these techniques greatly improves the agreement between the AC-DC differences of the two arrays as well as the absolute AC voltage accuracy.},

  abstract = {We have measured stepwise-approximated sine waves generated by a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) with several different output configurations. These data are analyzed to characterize the dominant error mechanisms for RMS applications, such as AC-DC difference measurements of thermal voltage converters (TVCs). We present detailed explanations of the fundamental causes and consequences of systematic errors that arise from transitions and consider the overall uncertainties for PJVS ac metrology using this synthesis method. We show that timing-related errors are sufficient to make this waveform synthesis approach impractical for RMS audio-frequency applications. The implications of providing the load current required by devices of low input impedance, such as TVCs, are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses the dynamics of different types of overdamped Josephson junctions biased by a sinusoidal microwave current. The results clarify the theoretical background for optimizing the single junction and the junction array parameters for their use as alternating current (ac) wave form synthesizers. The determined phase lock areas demonstrate the degree of overlap for Shapiro steps {[}S. Shapiro, Phys. Rev. Lett. 11, 80 (1963){]} of different orders as a function of the normalized frequency μ=2πf\$ømega\$c-1, where f is the microwave frequency and \$ømega\$c is the Josephson junction characteristic frequency. For μ≤0.7, which is a typical operation range for superconductor-insulator-superconductor Josephson junctions in the conventional direct current (dc) voltage standard at the bias frequency range from 10\&nbsp;to\&nbsp;100\&nbsp;GHz, the Shapiro steps overlap completely. For μ≥1.4 {[}typical for superconductor-normal-superconductor junctions at the same frequency range{]}, the steps do not overlap. This allows for ac voltage synthesis by means of binary arrays and pulse-driven systems. For 0.7≤μ≤1.4 there is a range of partially overlapping Shapiro steps, which allows a rapid switching of the Josephson dc voltages for ac synthesis by microwave power modulation. Experimentally we have achieved this range through properly designed superconductor-insulator-normal-insulator-superconductor junctions.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing Josephson stepwise approximated sine waves to produce an AC quantum standard is limited by errors in the waveform transitions between quantized voltages. Many parameters have an impact on the shape of the transients. A simple model with a single equivalent time constant can be used to evaluate the influence of these parameters. Measurements of the transients allow establishment of the value of the equivalent time constant and prediction of the response to variations of the parameters. We have experimentally confirmed the influence of changes in the bias current used for the quantized voltages and in the microwave power applied. Under usual operating conditions, the model predicts that increasing the number of samples per period nonlinearly reduces the difference between measured and ideal root-mean-square (rms) values. This behavior was confirmed through measurements with thermal converters.},

  abstract = {Programmable Josephson voltage standards (PJVSs) in combination with fast switchable DC current sources have opened up new applications in the field of low-frequency AC metrology. The growing interest in output voltages of up to plusmn10 V initiated efforts by several National Metrological Institutes to realize 10 V PJVSs. Presently, only 10 V PJVSs from PTB based on SINIS junctions have been successfully incorporated into existing setups for AC metrology. However, the fabrication of 10 V SINIS arrays that are driven at 70 GHz suffers from very low yield. The recent technological progress made at NIST enabled the drop-in replacement of the low-yield SINIS arrays by more robust SNS arrays. The N-material is an amorphous NbxSi1-x alloy near the metal-insulator transition and is deposited by co-sputtering. For the first time, fully operational 1 V and 10 V PJVSs with SNS junctions that are suitable for a 70 GHz drive have been fabricated and tested. This work was done in close cooperation between NIST and PTB.},

  abstract = {The Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer (JAWS) allows AC voltages to be generated with fundamental accuracy. Lumped arrays of superconductor/normal conductor/superconductor (SNS) Josephson junctions were developed and investigated for this application. Combining electron-beam lithography and chemical-mechanical polishing, series arrays of sub-micrometer SNS junctions consisting of Nb/HfTi/Nb were fabricated. The junction size varied from 0.04 mum2 to 4 mum2 in series arrays up to 2560 junctions in different microwave designs. Stable Shapiro steps are generated in a frequency range from 5 GHz to 20 GHz using continuous microwave irradiation. Using a simple pulse pattern at different pulse repetition frequencies, the arrays show current-voltage characteristics with flat Shapiro steps. Sinusoidal AC voltages were synthesized using a commercial pulse pattern generator. Peak-to-zero voltages of some mV for frequencies below 1 kHz were achieved. Higher harmonics were measured to be more than 80 dB below the fundamental tone. The behavior of the arrays was investigated in more detail by measuring the amplitude-frequency spectra.},

This paper describes a differential method that uses an integrating sampling voltmeter to precisely determine the amplitude and phase of high-purity and low-frequency (a few hundred hertz or less) sine-wave voltages. We have performed a variety of measurements to evaluate this differential technique. After averaging, the uncertainty obtained in the determination of the amplitude of a 1.2 V sine wave at 50 Hz is 0.3 muV/V (type A). Finally, we propose a dual-waveform approach for measuring two precision sine waves with the use of a single Josephson system. Currently, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a new calibration system for electrical power measurements based on this technique.},

Accumulated timing jitter occurs when the sine wave is sampled by an unstable clock where the clock periods are randomly changing. Also, accumulated jitter is a problem in ramp-type bases that were often used in sampling oscilloscopes. Expressions for an estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio {[}SNR\$\_\{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}backslash mathrm\{est.\}\vphantom{\{}\}){]} and phase variance in terms of the jitter distribution parameters and the number of FFT points (N) are derived.

Its linear dimensions should be small compared to the line wavelength in order to generate an ac voltage with quantum accuracy. Therefore, we use coplanar strip transmission lines to integrate a large number of cross-type SNS Josephson junctions into multiple parallel arrays. First measurements show that a circuit with 1,760 junctions exhibits Shapiro steps over a large frequency range. By using pulse driving the chip generates unipolar voltages up to 6.4 mV at a clock frequency of 3.5 GHz, the maximum frequency of the available pulse pattern generator.},

The programmable system is fully automated and provides stable programmable dc voltages from -1.2 V to +1.2 V. The synthesizer is the first quantum-based ac voltage standard source. It uses perfectly quantized Josephson pulses to generate arbitrary waveforms with low harmonic distortion and stable, calculable time-dependent voltages. Both systems are presently limited to output voltages less than 10 V as a result of frequency requirements and the limits of junction fabrication technology. We describe the development of fabrication technology for these systems and describe the circuit- and fabrication-related constraints that presently limit system performance. Finally, we propose the use of lumped arrays of junctions to achieve higher practical voltages through development of a nanoscale junction technology, in which 13 000 junctions are closely spaced at 50 nm-100 nm intervals},

Resistively shunted junction I-V characteristics were observed in the temperature range of 34–38\&nbsp;K. The ac Josephson effect was observed and flat giant Shapiro steps in arrays suggest good junction uniformity with a small spread in junction parameters. The temperature dependence of the critical current suggests that the nature of the interface between the superconductor and normal region can be described using a soft boundary proximity effect coupling model. We believe that the higher operating temperature and close spacing of these junctions make them promising candidates for quantum voltage standards and other devices.},

This technique enables the output voltage of the array to be directly grounded by removing the low-frequency common mode signal that previously prevented direct measurement of the array voltage with low-impedance instruments. We directly measure the harmonic spectra of 1 kHz and 50 kHz synthesized sine waves. We also use a thermal transfer standard to compare the rms voltages of synthesized sine waves at frequencies from 1 kHz to 50 kHz. Finally, we describe a new circuit that should enable a significant increase in output voltage by allowing several distributed arrays to be biased in parallel at high frequency, while combining their low frequency output voltages in series},

We show precision synthesized waveforms from dc to 100 kHz with measured distortion and harmonic content below 115 dBc (dB below the carrier or fundamental). The heart of the system is a superconducting microwave integrated circuit with two Josephson junction arrays biased in parallel for the microwave drive and connected in series to double the voltage for the audio frequency output waveforms. New superconducting integrated circuits with twice as many stacked junctions and improved microwave circuits have allowed us to more than double the output voltage of our recent system. We also demonstrate that quantum-based synthesized arbitrary waveforms (not just sine waves) can be used for precision measurements of a high-performance commercial analog-to-digital converter.},

The system is capable of generating two arbitrary waveforms by use of a dual-output PJVS (DO-PJVS) device. Owing to this dual-output feature of the PJVS system, the low-frequency characteristic in the ac-dc transfer difference of a thermal converter has been investigated using the 90° addition method. The evaluation of the low-frequency characteristic of a thermal converter is of great importance for connecting conventional ac-dc transfer standards and new Josephson-based ac voltage standards. To fulfill this purpose, a dual-heater thermal voltage converter (DH-TVC) with improved low-frequency performance has been developed. The low-frequency ac-dc transfer difference of the DH-TVC was evaluated to be smaller than 1 μV/V at frequencies of as low as 1 Hz.},

  abstract = {NIST is using and developing superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) Josephson arrays for both programmable DC and AC voltage standards. Increasing the output voltage is difficult because the output voltage per junction is small; hence series arrays with large numbers of junctions are needed. The best way to generate higher voltages and achieve the best operating margins for the broadband drive signals is by densely packing the junctions into shorter arrays. NIST has been working on stacked SNS junctions to achieve this goal. By stacking junctions in the array, more junctions may be placed per length, while preserving a lumped microwave element. In this paper we introduce our results on stacked SNS junctions using MoSi2 and Ti as barrier materials. These barriers were chosen because they can be reactive-ion etched (RIE) in contrast to our standard PdAu barriers, which must be wet etched. Using RIE, alternating layers of barrier material and Nb may be etched in a single step. We indirectly quantify the junction uniformity in the arrays by measuring the current range of the constant-voltage steps when the arrays are biased with a microwave drive.},

  abstract = {The National Institute of Standards and Technology has developed and implemented a new programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) that operates at 10 V. This next-generation system is optimized for both dc metrology and stepwise-approximated ac voltage measurements for frequencies up to a few hundreds of hertz. The nonhysteretic Josephson junctions produce intrinsically stable voltages and are designed to operate in the 18-20 GHz frequency range. The most recent 10 V PJVS circuits have total output current ranges greater than 1 mA.},

The procedure and equipment used for this work is briefly described. For the Zener standards we have tested, the temperature coefficients range from (1.6 to 5.4) nV/mega expressed by Zener output change versus thermistor resistance, and the pressure coefficients range from (1 to 20) nV/hPa. The time constant of Zener response to relative humidity change varies from days to nearly infinity. By choosing low noise and nonhumidity sensitive Zeners as transfer standards and correcting for the pressure and temperature effects, the uncertainties of a MAP can be improved},

The system accurately relates the spectral amplitudes and phases of the voltage and current waveforms of the generated power to a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) by using a novel differential sampling technique. The system also employs a new voltage amplifier that performs self-calibration and corrections of the gain and phase errors. Details of the system design, measurement techniques, and significant sources of error are presented.},

  abstract = {Recent metrological activities with programmable Josephson voltage standards (PJVS) are focused on extending the quantum accuracy to AC voltages, e.g. for the step-wise approximation of sine waves. Stimulated by the progress in this field, new requirements for the quality and availability of 1 V and 10 V circuits have been established. Based on the experience with programmable 1 V SINIS circuits fabricated at PTB and used at present by 13 National Metrological Institutes worldwide, the fabrication process and the microwave design were improved. The experience gained hereby enabled us to improve the properties of programmable 10 V SINIS arrays which were realized by us for the first time in 2000. The new 10 V circuits have 17 bit resolution and develop under 70 GHz microwave irradiation flat Shapiro steps at the 10 V level which are more than 600 muA wide. A direct comparison of the output voltage with a conventional 10 V SIS Josephson voltage standard confirmed the suitability for metrological applications. Incorporating 10 V-PJVS into existing AC metrology setups is expected to reduce their uncertainty budgets by about one order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {In this paper configurations of national standards of DC voltage often used in National metrological institutes are discussed. The typical configurations of scanner used for comparing voltages of bank of Zener reference standards and for Josephson voltage systems are described. Both systems are often used in laboratories of national rnetrological institutes. This leads to duplication of nanovoltmeters in a laboratory or often change of connecting wires. New scanner configuration used for the connection of the bank of Zener reference standards and Josephson voltage system together is presented. The advantage is the necessity of only one nanovoltmeter and the fixed configuration without the need of changing the wires for the current ongoing measurement. The drawback is that offsets of the scanner influence the Josephson voltage system measurements. This configuration was already tested in Czech Metrology Institute. Scanner offsets have been measured by means of two methods: by replacing the Zener reference standard with short and by using Zener reference standard as a test device. Results showed that the offsets were small enough compared to the noise of the Zener reference standard. Also stability of offsets was measured and was found sufficient. Therefore the new configuration is suitable for everyday measurements at national standard of DC voltage.},

  abstract = {In the 2001 JSM, Wendy Rotz, et al. presented the Comparison of Random Number Generators Used in Business. Based on this study, Microsoft revised Excel's Random Number Generator. Also since the 2001 research, one of the generators reviewed, RAT-STATS, had significant changes, and SAS introduced their new RAND function in version 8.2. This paper was intended to be an update of the current performance of these three packages. However, we found that we could not properly evaluate Excel’s random number generator (RNG) because the algorithm has not yet been fully integrated into the package. RAT-STATS had not changed enough to allow direct testing of their package, and we did not find it necessary to repeat tests on their reported algorithm. We did test the new RAND function in SAS 8.2 and found it now passes the DIEHARD battery of RNG tests and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical test suite for RNGs. This paper documents our findings in SAS and explains the current problems of testing in Excel and RAT-STATS.},

For the type of resistance elements employed in these shunts, the derivation of the reference is not very accurate and still needs to be improved.},

The key advantages of this method are that it relies on equipment that is readily available in most high-level laboratories and can be fully automated. The Type A uncertainties achieved by this approach can be less than 0.1 μV/V. This performance is achieved because of the excellent differential linearity of the DVM used in the method. We have validated the overall accuracy of the method by directly comparing this approach with more traditional resistive divider techniques and have established that the expanded uncertainty is better than 0.2 μV/V up to 1000 V, limited only by the performance of the instruments used.},

In one of the most recently published papers on the phase meter {[}l{]}, phase is measured by first converting the two input waves into two square waves and then measuring the time difference between the pulse centers of these two square waves. This technique is better than the conventional technique, where the phase is computed by measuring the time difference between the zero crossing points {[}4{]}, {[}5{]}. However, this technique may introduce large errors for some particular types of input waves. The main purpose of this paper is to explain how large the error could be under certain conditions on the input waves. The phase meter of {[}I{]} can be used when the phase can take values between 0 and 180 deg. Another paper 131 presents a technique for phase measurement where the phase can take values between - 180 and 180 deg.},

  abstract = {In this paper a novel and simple methodology for developing distinct load signatures is proposed. The analysis relies on the exhaustive utilization of the information embedded in the harmonic behavior of a load, towards the formulation of an appropriate data form that could describe the behavior of a Low Voltage (LV) load in a unique and representative way. Based only on the current magnitude during one period of the steady state, a special coefficient is formulated under a simple procedure determining the spectral distribution of the current. A load identification algorithm is also developed and presented in order to examine the robustness and effectiveness of the resulting load signatures. The results are very promising since they indicate that uniqueness in load signatures is indeed added by the proposed technique and hence, the improvement of the effectiveness of the signatures could contribute in more efficient Nonintrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) algorithms.},

One 100 pF travelling standard belonging to the CMI was used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A–B–A' pattern of measurements; the standard was measured first at the CMI for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the BIPM, and finally again at the CMI. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz and for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.b. The results from the CMI and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95\% confidence, k = 2) of 2.4 × 10−7. Main text.

For this exercise, three different measurement methods were carried out: the two different options of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol as well as the measurement protocol applied by NIST.

  abstract = {This report gives the results of a bilateral comparison of capacitance between the CMI (Czech Republic) and the BIPM carried out in 2009. One 100 pF travelling standard belonging to the CMI was used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A?B?A' pattern of measurements; the standard was measured first at the CMI for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the BIPM, and finally again at the CMI. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz and for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.b. The results from the CMI and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95\% confidence, k = 2) of 2.4 ? 10?7. Main text.

  abstract = {A theoretical development is presented which results in a relationship between the expectation value of the standard deviation of the frequency fluctuations for any finite number of data samples and the infinite time average value of the standard deviation, which provides an invariant measure of an important quality factor of a frequency standard. A practical and straightforward method of determining the power spectral density of the frequency fluctuations from the variance of the frequency fluctuations, the sampling time, the number of samples taken, and the dependence on system bandwidth is also developed. Additional insight is also given into some of the problems that arise from the presence of "flicker noise" (spectrum proportional to |ω|-1) modulation of the frequency of an oscillator. The theory is applied in classifying the types of noise on the signals of frequency standards made available at NBS, Boulder Laboratories, such as: masers (both H and N15H3), the cesium beam frequency standard employed as the U. S. Frequency Standard, and rubidium gas cells. "Flicker noise" frequency modulation was not observed on the signals of masers for sampling times ranging from 0.1 second to 4 hours. In a comparison between the NBS hydrogen maser and the NBS III cesium beam, uncorrelated random noise was observed on the frequency fluctuations for sampling times extending to 4 hours; the fractional standard deviations of the frequency fluctuations were as low as 5 parts in 1014.},
