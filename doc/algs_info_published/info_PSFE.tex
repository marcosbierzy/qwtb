\item [\textsf{.desc}] --- An algorithm for estimating the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the fundamental component in harmonically distorted waveforms. The algorithm minimizes the phase difference between the sine model and the sampled waveform by effectively minimizing the influence of the harmonic components. It uses a three-parameter sine-fitting algorithm for all phase calculations. The resulting estimates show up to two orders of magnitude smaller sensitivity to harmonic distortions than the results of the four-parameter sine fitting algorithm.
