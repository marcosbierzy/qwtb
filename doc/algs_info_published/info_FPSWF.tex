\item [\textsf{.name}] --- Four Parameter Sine Wave Fit
\item [\textsf{.desc}] --- Fits a sine wave to the recorded data by means of least squares fitting using 4 parameter (frequency, amplitude, phase and offset) model. An estimate of signal frequency is required. Due to non-linear characteristic, converge is not always achieved. When run in Matlab, function `lsqnonlin` in Optimization toolbox is used. When run in GNU Octave, function `leasqr` in GNU Octave Forge package optim is used.
\item [\textsf{.citation}] --- 
\item [\textsf{.remarks}] --- Algorithm works essentially only for simple sine wave. Algorithm is very sensitive to distortion. Algorithm requires good estimate of signal frequency.
