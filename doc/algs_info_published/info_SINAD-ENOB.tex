\item [\textsf{.desc}] ---  Algorithm calculates Ratio of signal to noise and distortion and Effective number of bits in time space, therefore it is suitable for noncoherent measurements. Requires estimates of the main signal component parameters: frequency, amplitude, phase and offset. If these values are estimated by four parameter sine wave fit, the SINAD and ENOB will be calculated according IEEE Std 1241-2000. A large sine wave should be applied to the ADC input. Almost any error source in the sine wave input other than gain accuracy and dc offset can affect the test result.
