\item [\textsf{.id}] --- FPSWF
\item [\textsf{.name}] --- Four Parameter Sine Wave Fit
\item [\textsf{.desc}] --- Fits a sine wave to the recorded data by means of least squares using 4 parameter model. Different functions are used when run in MATLAB or GNU Octave.
\item [\textsf{.citation}] --- 
\item [\textsf{.remarks}] --- Algorithm is very sensitive to distortion. Algorithm requires good estimate of frequency.
